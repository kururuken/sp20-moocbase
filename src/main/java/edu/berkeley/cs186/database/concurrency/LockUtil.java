/**
 * LockUtil is a declarative layer which simplifies multigranularity lock acquisition
 * for the user (you, in the second half of Part 2). Generally speaking, you should use LockUtil
 * for lock acquisition instead of calling LockContext methods directly.
 */
public class LockUtil {
    /**
     * Ensure that the current transaction can perform actions requiring LOCKTYPE on LOCKCONTEXT.
     *
     * This method should promote/escalate as needed, but should only grant the least
     * permissive set of locks needed.
     *
     * lockType is guaranteed to be one of: S, X, NL.
     *
     * If the current transaction is null (i.e. there is no current transaction), this method should do nothing.
     * 
     * First we get the current effective lock type for the transaction. Since effective lock type will not have SIX,
     * we will handle only the following 5 lock types
     * 
     * Some observations before we start
     * 
     * SIX - ... - SIX : possible, but intermediate lock type can only be IX or IS
     * S - ... - SIX: not possible
     * SIX - ... - S : possible, but intermediate lock type can only be IX or IS
     * 
     * Another conclusion we can get is that acquire and release only
     * applies to the bottom element in a locking tree, i.e. some context that does not have any child locks. If you want to modify some intermediate
     * element in a locking path, use promote or escalate. So we don't have to worry about other branches. We can simplify the model in to a direct path instead
     * of a branched tree.
     * 
     * 1. X
     *   We do nothing since we already have the most powerful lock type
     * 
     * 2. S
     *   If the requested lock type is S, then we do nothing.
     *   Else we have tot promote S to X. There are three possibilities
     *     i. 
     *       Current explicite lock type is SIX. In that case we don't care about ancestors, since they must be IX or SIX. 
     *       We only have to call escalate. After excalate, we don't have any childern holding locks, and if current explicit type 
     *       is X, then we are good. Otherwise we promote it to X.
     *     ii. 
     *       Current explicite lock type is S. In that case we don't care about children because S cannot have children. We only 
     *       care about ancestors, and they must all be IS or IX or SIX (it's possible to have SIX ancestor). We promote every IS to IX
     *       and leave IX and SIX as is.
     *     iii. 
     *       Current explicite lock type is NL. This means one of our ancestor will have type S or SIX (not X since our effective type will be X as well).
     *       In this case we go from bottom to top, promote any thing from NL to IX, until we encounter S or SIX
     *       If we encounter SIX, then we stop, because ancestors of SIX must be IX (maybe SIX, but doesn't matter)
     *       If we encounter S, promote any IS ancestors to IX and promote it to SIX.
     * 
     *  3. NL
     *     If effective type is NL, then all it's ancestors are intent locks or NL. 
     *     If we want S, then promote any NL ancestor to IS until we encounter one that is not NL
     *     If we want X, then promote any NL and IS ancestors to IX until we encounter one that is not.
     * 
     *  4. IS/IX
     *     We will only have ancestors with type IS/IX/SIX. But we might have descendents. So we should use escalate. 
     *     After escalate, if we don't have desire type, we should do another promote.
     *     One special case is we are holding IX and want to get S, in this case we promote to SIX directly without caring about descendents and ancestors.
     *
